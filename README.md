### Lab of Software Project Development 
## THE PROJECT 
The aim of our project is to create a very simple software able to, given some parameters, report to the user some wheter information. 

The software based itself on two main API sotwares: 
- *Opencage* API's to get geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) given a specific city name.
- *Current Weather* API's to get current weather information given specific coordinates. 

## Functionalities: 

The software would be able to provide the user with: 
- current weather information about the city selected 

## Parameters: 

The software parameters are: 
- geographical coordinates: latitude and longitude 
- the unique API key 

## Software responses: 

The software produces such responses: 
- Geographical coordinates 
- City name
- Weather
- Temperature 
- Feels like temperature 
- Maximum temperature 
- Minimum Temperature 
- Humidity
- Wind
- Sunrise hour
- Sunset hour
